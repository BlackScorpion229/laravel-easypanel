# How to install:

First of all you must install package with composer :
```bash
composer require rezaamini-ir/laravel-easypanel
```
Next you should publish config, migration and views just with one command :
```bash
php artisan panel:install
``` 
**Congratulations! You have installed the package.**

If You need to add TODO feature in your project you should run this command to create todo table:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
and you set the `todo` key in your config to `true`

## Configurations:

After run the `install:admin` command you are able to edit config file in `config/easy_panel.php`
There are lots of feature in config file you can edit or manage.

## CRUD Management
To create a CRUD action you can run this command :
```
php artisan panel:config article -m Article
```
it will create a crud config in `resources/cruds` directory for article action and Article model (action must be equal to model name) 

and next You should pass action name in `actions` key in your config file in `config` directory.

To create CRUDs action for all keys you must run this command : 
```bash
php artisan panel:crud
```
Or if you want to run command for just one key you can pass the key.
```bash
php artisan panel:crud article
```

To delete CRUDs action for all keys you can run this command : 
```bash
php artisan panel:delete
```
Or if you want to run command for just one key you can pass the key.
```bash
php artisan panel:delete article
```

There are some important notes about actions in your config file :
- the action key must be equal to model name in lower case
- every fields (values in your db) should be passed in `fields` key
- pass the true address of model 

After run these commands you are able to edit and customize your CRUD style and component in your project
- PHP Components address : `app/Http/Livewire/Admin/[ActionKey]`
- Blade Components address : `resources/views/livewire/admin/[actionKey]`

So let's install and create a CRUD action for User model in 2 minutes.

1.After install the package with composer in project, we install admin panel :

Done, We created a panel with user manager option in 3 steps :)

#### Create/Delete admin

There are 2 commands in EasyPanel which uses UserProvider class to set a user as an admin or remove it.

To set a user as an admin You can use this command :

```
php artisan panel:add 1
```

And to remove a user You can user this command : 

```
php artisan panel:remove 1
```

**1 is `user.id` here**

### What does every key in config file ?

- `enable` key gives you an option to disable or enable whole module, do you want to disable admin panel ? set it `false`
-  `todo` : it gives a `boolean` value. if You set it to `true` You will have a TODO list in your panel
- `user_model`, if You have a different model for users of you don't use from Laravel 8.x you should pass your own user model in this key.

- As i said at top, EasyPanel is so flexible, You can pass your `UserProvider` or `Auth` class in config file. Image you have a separate table for admins and You don't use column for authenticate admins, You can write your own UserProvider and your own Auth class and pass it to config to use it.

- What is `show` key in every action in config file ? It specifies what's column should be showed in CRUD list.
For example you want to show only title in your articles list, you can just pass the `title` to the `show` key in config file.
- `actions` : every CRUD you want to have. If you want to disable a crud in panel just remove it from `actions` key in config file.
- `extra_values` in cruds' config : Imagine you want pass a default data when you want to create an article or anything, and you want to pass `user_id` in you create method, you can set `user_id` in your `extra_values` key (If you want to write some code, place codes between " or ' )

* More about `show` : If you want to show a value from a relationship for example show article author with `user_id` column in articles table you must pass a array in `show` key and key of this value should be equal to column and value should be column name in related table like this : `'user_id' => 'name'` it will show name of author of this article :)
